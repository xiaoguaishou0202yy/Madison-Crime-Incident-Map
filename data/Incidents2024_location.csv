In reviewing reports on this incident, it sounds like victims are being greeted with a popup in their banking software telling them that a transfer of funds has been validated to a possible illicit activity, accusing the victim of engaging in illegal activity. The pop-up also has a phone number to call.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Once the number has been called, victims report being transferred to other phone lines or being asked to wait on calls. After being on the phone, they are asked to drain money from their accounts in order to transfer it to another individual so that the initial fraud could be investigated. Once all the money from their account is drained out, victims are being encouraged to purchase gold and to transfer that money.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

The Madison Police Department is aware of these cases and is actively investigating them. To keep your accounts safe, the Madison Police Department recommends:<br />

&nbsp;<br />

Be cautious of any entity asking you to quickly transfer funds over the phone.<br />

If you see suspicious activity on your accounts, report it to your banking entity.<br />

Remember that law enforcement will not ask for funds in exchange for us to investigate a crime or alleged fraud.<br />

Take time to conduct internet searches of numbers given by these pop ups to see if they are legitimate.<br />

If someone is claiming you transferred funds from your account, take the time to independently verify if this occurred (logging onto your bank account or contacting your local branch).<br />

<br />

?The Madison Police Department will be joining law enforcement agencies across Wisconsin and the United States in stepping up the enforcement of seatbelt laws.&nbsp;The high-visibility&nbsp;Click It or Ticket&nbsp;seatbelt campaign, which coincides with the beginning of the busy summer travel season, runs from May 20 through June 2, 2024.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

The purpose of the campaign is to remind motorists about the importance of seatbelt use, enforce the life-saving habit of wearing a seatbelt, and reduce the number of fatalities that occur when drivers and passengers fail to buckle up.&nbsp; Wisconsin’s primary seatbelt law allows law enforcement to stop and cite motorists for failing to wear a seatbelt. Drivers can also be cited for every unbuckled passenger in their vehicle.<br />

<br />

Wearing your seatbelt is one of the easiest and most effective steps you can take to survive a crash.&nbsp; If you know a friend or a family member who does not buckle up when they drive, please ask them to consider changing their habits. Help us spread this lifesaving message before one more friend or family member is killed as a result of this senseless inaction. Seat belts save lives, and everyone — front seat and back, child and adult — needs to remember to buckle up.<br />

<br />

The Madison Police Department and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation are asking for your help with making our roads safer and achieving zero travel-related deaths in Wisconsin.&nbsp;<br />

<br />

Please buckle up.&nbsp; Every trip.&nbsp; Every time.",Lt. Jennifer Hannah,-89.3825501,43.0723971,,,,,

<br />

As the weather gets warmer, more people will be on the roads, including pedestrians and bicyclists.&nbsp; This month, the Madison Police Department will be conducting extra patrols that will focus on enforcing Wisconsin's bicycle and pedestrian laws. &nbsp;In addition, MPD will continue to work with the Dane County Sheriff’s Officer to enforce seatbelt, alcohol, and speed laws.&nbsp; These additional enforcement efforts are made possible through traffic overtime grants provided by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.&nbsp;<br />

<br />

The goal of these extra patrols is not just to arrest drivers.&nbsp; The mission is to enhance public safety and prevent needless tragedies by discouraging people from making dangerous decisions and engaging in unsafe behaviors while driving. The Madison Police Department wants you to have fun this summer, but reminds you to celebrate responsibly.<br />

&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;- Always drive 100% sober. Even one alcoholic beverage could be one too many. &nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;- Plan ahead: Before you have even one drink, designate a sober driver to get you home safely.<br />

&nbsp;- You have options to get home safely: designate a sober driver or call a taxi or rideshare. Getting home safely is always worth it.<br />

&nbsp;- If it’s your turn to be the designated driver, take your job seriously and don’t drink.<br />

&nbsp;- If you have a friend who is about to drink and drive, take the keys away and let a sober driver get your friend home safely.<br />

<br />

We need your help in making our roads safer.&nbsp;Please, put your cell phone down, buckle up, slow down, drive sober, and watch out for and yield to pedestrians and bicyclists.",Lt. Jennifer Hannah,-89.3825501,43.0723971,,,,,
