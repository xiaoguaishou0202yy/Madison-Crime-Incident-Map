In the news: Nationally, President Nixon’s attorney has revealed the existence of an 18 ½ -minute gap in a White House tape recording. Here in Madison, a 41-year-old downtown resident, a deer hunter, notifies the MPD that his rifle has been stolen from his 1966 GMC truck that was unlocked and parked on S. Baldwin St.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The victim had left the gun beneath a blanket in the truck’s bed. It was no ordinary weapon, rather a German Mauser, regarded as one of the finest military bolt action rifles in history: standard issue for the Nazis in World War II. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Official police reports of the Mauser theft have been maintained for decades at the MPD, even though the case had been long since cold.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, there’s good reason for keeping good records.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On January 28th of this year, a MPD property clerk was contacted by a police detective from Circleville Ohio, about 25 miles south of Columbus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The detective said someone had turned in a German Mauser. The serial number indicated it had been stolen in Madison.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rifle, in an evidence box, has now just been shipped to the MPD’s Property Room.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has now been determined the gun’s owner passed away in 1998.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, his children are still alive, and are being contacted 47 years after their dad reported the crime.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus recently topped the charts. Donald Trump is now the U.S. President, and the bolt action Mauser, stolen in ’73, is back in Madison.<br />

(UPDATED Monday, April 14, 2008)

The Madison Police Department is seeking additional information from people who were in the Bassett Neighborhood either on the day Brittany was killed, or on the day before her death. Specifically, detectives would like to speak with anyone who was solicited for money – or gave money to strangers - on either April 1st or April 2nd.  This would include citizens who were approached on the street, or at their homes, by one or more individuals. Investigators are focusing this effort on solicitations that were made on West Washington Ave., West Main St., West Wilson St., South Bedford St., South Bassett St., or West Doty Street.  The MPD would ask those with information to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.


(UPDATED FRIDAY APRIL 11, 2008)

Posters seeking information in the Brittany Sue Zimmermann case will soon be posted by Madison Police Officers in the Bassett Neighborhood, and in other areas of the central city. A copy of the poster has been attached to this incident report. 

Madison Crime Stoppers has now received approximately 200 tips in the Zimmermann case. In addition, some 25 new tips have come in reference the Joel Marino homicide. Joel was murdered on January 28th, and prior to Brittany’s homicide around 70 tips had been received in the Marino investigation.

There are some similarities in the cases. Both residents were killed inside their homes, during daylight hours, and no motive has been established in either case. There appears to be nothing in either victim’s background that would make them targets of violence. 

Still, investigators do not know if the cases are connected, and there are differences. For example, in the Zimmermann case there were signs of forced entry. There was no evidence of forced entry in the Marino case. 

Both Marino and Zimmermann lived in close proximity, perhaps a mile or so apart. Because of the closeness detectives working the Marino case are coming across information that may help the Zimmermann case. Conversely, detectives working the Zimmermann case are coming across information that may aid the Marino probe.

Both cases remain very active investigations.





(UPDATED MONDAY APRIL 7)

Some members of the media have been inquiring about a man who was going to various locations in the downtown (including a residence on West Washington Avenue) soliciting money from residents on the day of Brittany's death. This person is in custody on a probation hold, and is one of many who have been arrested (for things like probation holds and unrelated crimes) during the Zimmermann investigation. No suspect has been identified in the murder of Brittany. Detectives are continuing to pursue a plethora of leads. The MPD appreciates all of those who have come forward with information, and encourages others to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014 as this remains a very active investigation. 

(UPDATED PRESS INFORMATION: RELEASED FRIDAY APRIL 4, 2008)

The Madison Police Department, with assistance from the WI State Crime Laboratory, continued Friday to process the home of Brittany Sue Zimmermann. 

Forensic analysts at the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison are already expediting the examination of some items found that may have evidentiary value.

Meanwhile, the focus of the investigation continues on several fronts. Patrol officers and detectives have been talking with numerous people in the neighborhood including residents, commuters, business owners, and transients.   Police are seeking to speak with those who are willing to share information, and those who may be somewhat reluctant to contact police directly.   Police seek any information regarding activity in the area.   

In the Zimmermann case, the MPD would like citizens to focus on the daytime – going into the nighttime hours -- of Wednesday April 2nd.   If anyone saw anything odd, strange, or out of the ordinary in the area of the crime scene—a call to Crime Stoppers (608-266-6014) would be appreciated.

In the last 24 hours more than 75 tips have come in to Crime Stoppers. Many of those calls are from people who have had strangers come to their doors, or into their homes recently, or over the course of the past several months. Several callers said at the time they did not call police. The MPD would urge anyone, at anytime, encountering a similar situation to call. 

Other tips in the Zimmermann investigation have come from downtown residents who saw people going door to door asking for money on the day of the homicide. In at least one case a man entered a residence. Investigators have identified many of these people, and have talked with them. It is not unusual during such contacts that arrests are made for unrelated matters. For instance, some contacts are made with those who may have outstanding warrants, or are wanted on probation holds.

At this hour the MPD does not have a suspect, or suspects identified in the Zimmermann homicide.  The Dane County Coroner has determined Brittany died from a “complexity of traumatic injuries.”  Investigators have not established a motive. 

Madison and UW police officers will continue increased foot patrols in the Bassett Street Neighborhood.









(UPDATED THURSDAY APRIL 3 @ 12:20 p.m.)

Investigators in the Brittany Zimmermann homicide have concluded that her boyfriend is not a suspect in this case. 

He has been -- and continues to be -- very helpful in providing information to the detective team.

Many leads have come in, and detectives are pursuing them. No suspect has been identified.

The search of Brittany's home -- and the area around it -- continues.  Items of possible evidentiary value are being taken to the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison for analysis.

A member of the Dane County's Victim/Witness unit is working with Brittany's family. She will be keeping them posted on developments in the case, and has informed the MPD that the family is asking for privacy as they continue to grieve.

A good number of tips have come in to the MPD, and citizens with any information that may help lead to an arrest are encouraged to continue to call the Madison Police Crime Stoppers line at 608-266-6014.

(ORIGINAL RELEASE)
Shortly after 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday Madison Police were called to a residence in the 500 block of West Doty Street to check on a person. Ms. Zimmermann was found dead inside her home. Dane County Coroner John Stanley says a preliminary examination indicates the manner of death was homicide. 

The Madison Police Department is working in unison with the UW-Madison Police Department on this case, and a Command Post has been established inside the Central District station.

Both Madison Police Chief Noble Wray, and UW Police Chief Susan Riseling have pledged extra patrols, and a heightened presence on Doty Street and surrounding areas for the time being.

At this writing no suspects have been identified, and detectives have been unable to rule out that this may have been a random act.

District Alderman Mike Verveer is looking to hold a community meeting this weekend to address concerns of residents.

Meanwhile, a team of detectives will work the case around the clock, with patrol officers aiding in their efforts.

Coroner Stanley has indicated a forensic examination will be done tomorrow morning at which time he may (or may not -- depending on consultation with investigators) release more information on the cause of death.

""This terrible crime is a tragedy, and my thoughts are with the victim's family and friends,"" said Mayor Dave Cieslewicz.

She threw them in the backseat of the getaway car, and jumped in the passenger seat. The driver accelerated in the direction of the officer and that of the security guard. The officer quickly stepped aside, yelling for the security guard to watch out. The security guard tried to protect himself but ended up getting clipped by the car. The officer broadcast the car’s description and license plate number.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another officer spotted the car and pulled it over in the 700 block of N. Thompson Dr.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driver Melvin R. Horton, age 61, Madison, was arrested for second degree reckless endangerment, and being party to retail theft. Stephanie M. Roll, age 44, no permanent address, was arrested for retail theft and bail jumping.<br />

The 20-year-old victim was not certain exactly where he was at the time of the attack, but told officers he was walking in a dark area when a robber emerged wearing a dark hoodie with the hood up.

2118 W. Beltline Highway,25349,Theft,2020-84615,2020/02/29 18:26:00+00,,,,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPD K9 Bowie led a successful track Saturday afternoon locating an $800 stolen welder that was hidden in a mound of snow in wooded area off of the W. Beltline Highway.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The welder had been stolen from Northern Tool and Equipment, 2118 W. Beltline Highway. An employee had chased after two suspects. The worker was kicked and pushed by the men, who threatened to further “beat” the employee if he did not back off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thieves continued to run, hiding the welder along the way, likely with hopes of retrieving it at a later time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspects had originally arrived in a getaway car, but it never made it out of the Northern Tool parking lot. A community member, who was outside in his vehicle, saw the original thief running from the store, carrying the welder, with an employee in hot pursuit. He realized the thief was running toward the getaway car, and that the getaway car would be stuck if he used his own vehicle to block the lot’s exit. And so that’s what he did, and it worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However the thief, and a passenger who got out of the getaway car, took off on foot, leaving a somewhat naïve 17-year-old behind the wheel. He did not try to run off, and readily admitted to making a very poor decision by taking part in the crime. He was very apologetic saying to police saying he does not know the other young men well, and that one had offered to pay him if he would drive them to get some food. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An officer counseled the teen on choosing more trustworthy friends.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officers have surveillance video and are working at identifying the thieves. The cooperative 17-year-old has not been arrested at this point.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The victim was at Danny’s Pub, 328 W. Gorham St. when the theft took place. She soon learned her debit card was successfully used at Capitol Centre Market, 111 N. Broom St., where the suspect’s image was captured on video surveillance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Sunday afternoon, the victim could see her phone tracking somewhere in the Eken Park neighborhood. She and her mother realized there was Boost Mobile store in the area, and went there. They told a clerk about the situation, provided information about the stolen phone, and asked the employee to please contact them if someone arrived trying to sell it.<br />
It was the beginning of a successful dragnet. The suspect arrived with the stolen phone. The clerk inspected it, and used it to text the victim’s mother. She then stalled the suspect, giving mom and daughter time to arrive.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an animated verbal exchange between involved parties prompting the employee to call 911.<br />
The suspect, who told the victim and her mother they were crazy, that he had done nothing wrong, tried to leave. Mom stepped in front of the door and locked it. She said the suspect next struck her with an open hand and pushed her down. He tried to leave again. Seeing this scenario from her car seat, the mother’s younger daughter, raced toward the store’s door and pushed it shut from the outside.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this time, mom was calling for help, and a couple of passersby intervened, all working to keep the suspect inside until officers arrived.<br />

He was in the hospital for surgery, and she was carrying for Anika, until Tuesday, when Anika bolted out of an open door. The owner’s daughter and a friend spent the better part of the night searching, but to no avail.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the daughter was working with the officers. A MPD drone operator was brought in, but power lines prevented good aerial surveillance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point, the daughter needed to drop from the search party in order to go pick up her dad, who was being discharged.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During her absence, officers continued the hunt, finally spotting Anika down by a creek. They kept a close eye on her for over an hour, but did not want to too close for fear of spooking Anika again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, father and daughter were with the officers: dad still clad in his hospital pajamas and slippers. All worked in concert to get Anika back on a leash.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming off surgery, having a man’s best friend back to help&nbsp;with recuperation was very much appreciated. So much so, the owner offered the officers a handsome reward: Green Bay Packers tickets.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A MPD Special Events Team (SET) was away from the gathering on State Capitol grounds, giving people space to exercise their First Amendment rights. The team was ready to deploy to State Street, should looting and other violence erupt again. The following is an account from one of its members:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We formed a line in front of Grace Episcopal Church, when we were approached by three protesters. As I recall, two were black men, and one was a black woman. The woman informed SET that the peaceful protest was over, and she was leaving. She went on to tell us that she would go down to the top of State Street, encourage the group to leave, and inform them that the protest was over. The woman made clear that whoever remained would know that their decision could carry a consequence. The woman then&nbsp;headed down to the top of State Street, and I could hear&nbsp;her voice in what I understood to be an attempt to speak with the group. The woman returned back to our position, and she wished SET a safe night.&nbsp;Her group also handed out flowers to SET officers, and I do not know an officer who turned the offer down. Many officers carried the flowers on them during the subsequent clear of State Street (after looting broke out).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, this week has been extremely challenging for so many. I thought it was incredibly brave for these three individuals to approach the police, and offer a gesture of kindness. This demonstrated to me what almost all of us recognize - many of those in the crowd wish to lawfully&nbsp;express their constitutional liberties, and only a small group of people are causing the chaos we have seen. SET is absolutely committed to protecting lawful protest, and this commitment is why I joined the team.&nbsp;Unfortunately, SET's responsibilities to public safety limit our ability&nbsp;to engage in a&nbsp;conversation about what is happening&nbsp;while in hard gear, but many SET officers noted how remarkable and kind this moment was.”<br />

2900 block Industrial Drive,26608,Information,2020-207503,2020/06/10 02:00:00+00,,,,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time of year, females can move relatively long distances. It is egg laying time, and the hunt for new habitat is instinctual, yet often times dangerous.<br />
Such was the case last Tuesday night on Industrial Drive. By the time an officer arrived, it appeared a slow moving snapping turtle, which was in the roadway, had just escaped certain death. Its shell was freshly scraped, and it appeared a passing car’s undercarriage had caused damage, but no serious injury.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer attempted to encourage the turtle’s forward progress by pushing it with a police baton. However, snapping turtles are known for having rather combative dispositions, and true to form, this one responded by looking at the officer while repeatedly opening and shutting its powerful beak-like jaws.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The turtle was also very heavy to just push,” noted the officer. She next attempted to get it on top of a plastic sheet, with thoughts of pulling it across rain-slicked pavement. “However the turtle’s claws were very sharp and ripped up the plastic sheet,” said the officer. It was time for backup: “I do not have experience with moving a large snapping turtle, so I requested assistance.”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for an officer with a more extensive wildlife background, “I tried to use verbal commands to get the turtle to move across the road. However, the turtle continued to assess me as a threat and kept trying to snap/bite in my direction.”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the second officer arrived, he explained you need to move a snapping turtle by lifting it with two hands, just above the rear legs, but not by the turtle’s tail as that can cause spinal damage.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, the hoist was made. The turtle was now making rapid progress on its journey, yet continued to show displeasure with human contact.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may have been unwanted, but the initial officer was very pleased with the outcome of the safe passage, writing in her report: “Hopefully the turtle will continue to live a long snappy life.”<br />
She decided to name it for its behavior and home turf: “Snappy the South Side Turtle”<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The politician said he was walking to the State Capitol around midnight when he saw a group of demonstrators in the street. He decided to use his phone to capture what was happening. As he did, three people rushed toward him, saying something about his phone. One knocked it out of his hand. He said he was then sucker punched. He fell to the ground and was battered by several people.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A media member, who witnessed the assault, told police approximately ten people punched and kicked the politician while he was on the ground and as the politician tried to explain that he is an ally.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the beating stopped, the politician tried to dialogue with his attackers, explaining who he was, and asking for his phone and glasses to be returned. They were, and someone identifying herself as a nurse came to his aid.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling “lightheaded, stunned and dazed” he next stumbled toward the State Capitol, where he laid down on the grass.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made contact with Capitol Police who called for an emergency medical response. Paramedics treated the politician, but he declined to go to a hospital.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capitol Police escorted him into the Capitol, and told him not to leave the building because of property damage and unruly behavior that was continuing to take place outside.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The victim ventured there, and stood behind the suspect in line, watching as he used the victim’s stolen credit card to buy multiple packs of cigarettes. The 20-year-old did not engage the suspect, wanting to stay safe, but did watch as the man headed outside, handing out packs of smokes to friends.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man continued to follow the suspect, but lost him as he called police.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An officer went to the Walgreens seeking clues. Because the man had purchased cigarettes, he was required to provide a photo ID, and his image was captured on surveillance cameras.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer went back outside, and soon spotted the suspect in the 500 block of State Street. Ronald Watson, age 56, Madison, told the officer he had made some purchases at Walgreens, but &nbsp;did so with a credit card given to him by a guy known downtown as “Shorty.”<br />
“Shorty,” said the suspect, is not allowed in Walgreens, and asked for assistance in buying some items. The officer said the story was not making sense, since Watson was still holding a Walgreens bag containing packs of cigarettes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer also used other surveillance cameras to track Watson to places very near the victim’s apartment, right around the time of the burglary.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watson was arrested for misappropriation of personal identifying materials and felony bail jumping.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Central District officers are aware of an individual who goes by the moniker, “Shorty.” They located and talked with “Shorty,” and “Shorty” said he had nothing to do with any of what Watson was talking about.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like another great day for a run, but whether you live downtown or elsewhere, the MPD recommends you lock your doors.<br />

His wife was attuned to what was happening and asked a 911 communicator to have the MPD check on the victim’s sister. She also lives in Madison. She was fine. The victim also told the caller he wanted to speak with his sister, prior to transferring the funds. The caller refused, and soon hung up. &nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
The Madison Area has seen several catalytic converter thefts in recent months.&nbsp; Here are a few crime prevention tips:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>If possible, park in well-lit areas and close to building or building entrances.</li>
	<li>Park in a garage, if possible and lock the doors .</li>
	<li>Have the catalytic converter welded to your car's frame, which may make it harder to steal.&nbsp; Also there are several aftermarket items that can be purchased that your certified auto mechanic can install that would prevent or help prevent the theft.</li>
	<li>Consider engraving your vehicle identification number (VIN) on the catalytic converter.&nbsp; This may assist in recovering your catalytic converter if it is stolen.</li>
	<li>Calibrate your Car's alarm to set off when it detects vibration.&nbsp; The suspects in this crime normally use a battery operation reciprocating saw and it creates a lot of noise and vibration when it is being removed.</li>
	<li>If your able to park your vehicle in a way to limit access to the bottom of the vehicle as much as possible.</li>
	<li>Install cameras home or vehicle that would capture the image of the suspect committing the crime.</li>
	<li>Most importantly if you see or hear anything suspicious please notify your local law enforcement as soon as possible.&nbsp;</li>

<strong>What You Can Do to Avoid a Scam</strong><br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Block unwanted calls and text messages.&nbsp;</strong>Take steps to block unwanted calls and to filter unwanted text messages.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Don’t give your personal or financial information in response to a request that you didn’t expect.</strong>&nbsp;Legitimate organizations won’t call, email, or text to ask for your personal information, like your Social Security, bank account, or credit card numbers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">If you get an email or text message from a company you do business with and you think it’s real, it’s still best not to click on any links. Instead, contact them using a website you know is trustworthy. Or look up their phone number. Don’t call a number they gave you or the number from your caller ID</div>

According to the <a href=""https://www.nicb.org/news/news-releases/catalytic-converter-theft-skyrocketing-nationwide"">National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB)</a>, catalytic converter thefts have been skyrocketing nationwide:
<div style=""margin-left:40px""><em>“Removing a catalytic converter takes only minutes using some basic, readily-available, battery-operated tools from a local hardware store and for the vehicle owner, it’s costly due to the loss of work, finding and paying for alternate transportation and then paying anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 to get your vehicle fixed.” - NICB</em></div>
<br />
The NICB recommends vehicle owners:
<ul>
	<li>Install a catalytic converter anti-theft device. These are available from various manufacturers and can provide a level of security from theft.</li>
	<li>Park fleet vehicles in an enclosed and secured area that is well lit, locked, and alarmed.</li>
	<li>Park personal vehicles in a garage. If not possible and vehicles must be parked in a driveway, consider installing motion sensor security lights. While lights may not provide complete security, it may make some thieves think twice, making them leave the area and your vehicle untouched.</li>
	<li>Call local law enforcement and your insurer should you become the victim of a catalytic converter theft.</li>

The drone hovered for a few minutes over the fans, field, players and officials before flying off.&nbsp; This is a reminder of drone use as high school and college sporting events resume outdoors throughout our area.&nbsp; Per the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), drones cannot be flown over people and crowds without specific waivers the FAA provides.&nbsp; The Madison Police Department understands the increased popularity of drones, however owners have a responsibility to understand the important rules setforth by the FAA to keep everyone safe.&nbsp; Local law enforcement can respond to drone complaints on behalf of the FAA.&nbsp; Below are rules, under Part 107, for drone operators to know:<br />
<br />
Just as there are rules of the road when driving a car, there are rules of the sky when operating a drone.<br />
<br />
-Always avoid manned aircraft.<br />
-Never operate in a careless or reckless manner.<br />
-Keep your drone within sight. If you use First Person View or similar technology, you must have a visual observer always keep your drone within unaided sight (for example, no binoculars).<br />
-You cannot be a pilot or visual observer for more than one drone operation at a time.<br />
-Do not fly a drone over people unless they are directly participating in the operation.<br />
-Do not operate your drone from a moving vehicle or aircraft unless you are flying your drone over a sparsely populated area and it does not involve the transportation of property for compensation or hire.<br />
<br />
You can fly during daylight (30 minutes before official sunrise to 30 minutes after official sunset, local time) or in twilight if your drone has anti-collision lighting. Minimum weather visibility is three miles from your control station. The maximum allowable altitude is 400 feet above the ground, higher if your drone remains within 400 feet of a structure. Maximum speed is 100 mph (87 knots).<br />

<br />
An investigation revealed that Tokiee D. Sole (age 43 of Madison), had been involved in an altercation with another adult&nbsp;that he shares a domestic relationship with. During this incident, Sole is alleged to have fired a firearm numerous times with bullets striking a vehicle and nearby building. No persons were struck, however it was believed that Sole fired the gun intentionally at the other person involved.<br />
<br />
Sole then left the area in a vehicle prior to officers arriving on scene.<br />
<br />
Thanks to a quick response by numerous law enforcement agencies (Dane Co. Sheriff, Town of Madison Police, UW Madison Police), Sole’s vehicle was spotted and stopped. During the stop, less lethal munitions were used to subdue Sole who was non-compliant. Sole was taken into custody without injury, and a search after the arrest yielded a loaded firearm.<br />

1710 Mckenna Blvd,28612,Information,0000-000000,2021/10/14 05:00:00+00,,,,"The Madison Police Department’s West District share concerns and are especially troubled by the relatively new escalation involving residents being confronted at gunpoint in and around their vehicles and homes. As many of you know, this is the third such incident since August 19th in a relatively small area to the South and West of McKee Rd and Maple Grove Drive. MPD believes that these three cases are related and are being committed by a small group of individuals who are becoming increasingly more brazen. These three cases are also likely related to the extensive property crime spree that took place during the overnight hours of October 5th where MPD took over 40 reports involving forced entry theft from auto, criminal damage to property, and burglaries. Finally, it appears the involved individuals have been associated with weapons offenses in Madison in recent months.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To be clear, this most recent violent person and property crime spree do NOT fit within what is often referred to as crimes of opportunity. When that phrase is used, we are typically referring to unlocked and unoccupied vehicles or persons entering open unoccupied garages. Individuals involved in these cases typically have no plans of interacting with or confronting residents and generally do not engage in a forced entry or property damage. In those cases, we know that the most effective strategy is one of prevention by locking doors and keeping valuable secure and out of public view. Again, this most recent crime spree does not fit this description and no resident behavior or action is to blame for this. We collectively should not expect and should never accept criminals pointing guns at residents to take property by force. This spree is MPD’s number one priority and we will do everything to bring it to an end.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What are West PD and MPD doing?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The crime spree occurring in the South end of the West District (Aldermanic District 7) is being investigated by West PD Detectives along with the Burglary Crime Unit and the Gang Neighborhood Crime Abatement Team. Additionally, related cases are being investigated by the other MPD Districts. MPD is actively working with the Dane County Stolen Auto Workgroup as well as agencies outside of Dane County who have cases with ties to our spree. It is MPD’s hope and expectation that we will have arrests in these cases to report to you all in the coming days. MPD is working with our Criminal Intelligence Section to analyze data to better inform our preventative strategies and to link cases together. While detectives work to identify, locate and arrest the persons responsible, MPD will work to increase presence in the targeted areas. MPD will do this through assigned directed patrols in the overnight hours (known as 4th and 5th Patrol Details). To bolster patrol resources who are likely to get pulled away for other in-progress priority calls for service, West PD is developing a problem-solving initiative and will soon request additional resources to increase police presence in this specific area. This is a short-term intervention and not sustainable over the long run but it is needed at this time.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In general, residents are always encouraged to be alert, vigilant, and to report all suspicious activity to Dane County Dispatch via 911 or the non-emergency dispatch line at 608-255-2345. MPD recommends the following until this spree has abated:<br />
<br />
- The three carjacking cases have occurred between the hours of 11:00 PM and 2:00 AM with residents arriving home to generally empty streets. MPD’s sense at this time is that suspects have a connection to this area of the city and are in the area and looking for an additional vehicle for use in their criminal activities. They appear to be watching for an alone occupant approaching a residence and typically approach immediately as the vehicle comes to a stop. This is likely done in the hope that the vehicle is still unlocked, running, or at least with keys still in the ignition or easily accessible. Be aware of your surroundings as you approach your residence and watch for occupied cars in the area.&nbsp;<br />
- Considering notifying a family member or neighbor of your arrival time and ask for someone to standby with lights on to greet you and see you safely into your residence.<br />
- If you observe suspicious activity as you arrive to the area of your home and feel unsafe exiting your vehicle, remain in your locked car and contact Dane County Dispatch via 911 to request an officer to respond to check the area and confirm your safety.<br />
- If parking in your garage, consider remaining in the car with the car door locked until the garage door is fully down.<br />
- If parking on the street, in a parking lot, or a driveway, pause momentarily after coming to a stop. Keep car doors locked and monitor the area. If being approached by another vehicle, remain in your locked vehicle and consider your route out of the area should you decide that it would be best to drive away out of the area and call for assistance.<br />
- If confronted by an armed person demanding your property, separate yourself from your property, and move slowly away from the armed suspect(s). Your personal safety is the priority in these situations. Protect yourself and do your very best to be the best possible witness you can be to pass along detailed information to the officers who will respond when notified.<br />
- Assess the area around your home for large areas of darkness that can be addressed with additional lighting. Consider parking in the best lit area possible.<br />
- Assess your routines, especially related to returning home in overnight hours of darkness. Give thought to your route home and where you would expect to see parked cars. Watch for occupied parked vehicles or vehicles moving slowly in the neighborhood. If you routinely arrive home between the hours of 11 PM and 2:00 am in the area recently being targeted, consider working with a family member or neighbor to have someone meet you as you arrive with additional exterior lights on.&nbsp;<br />
- As neighborhood associations or apartment complexes, increase information sharing to keep residents aware of updates to this spree and/or new criminal behavior in the area.<br />
<br />
MPD has also received questions about security cameras and whether they are useful to MPD investigations:<br />
- Absolutely. Video collected in these cases is used to build cases against the individuals involved, even if only to establish a timeline of incidents and to link multiple cases together.&nbsp;<br />
- This can be a time-consuming process and can at times overwhelm our resources, especially in the more prolific sprees such as the October 5th forced entry theft from auto spree, but every piece of information helps to complete the picture and move these cases along.<br />
- When you are aware of criminal activity in your neighborhood, check your camera footage for any potentially useful video evidence. If you find something on your camera footage, contact MPD who can then assess whether we will collect it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Crime prevention is everyone's responsibility, and it starts with all of us in the community working in partnership. MPD’s many partnerships and efforts through our neighborhood officers, community policing teams, gang unit, and our community outreach units focus on building and strengthening relationships, especially with our youth. MPD is confident that we will collectively bring this crime spree to an end and the individuals responsible will be held accountable. Your safety is our priority and we will do everything we can to protect you and your property. Citizens are encouraged to reach out to their respective districts with questions or concerns, MPD is willing to arrange a neighborhood meeting at any time upon request.",P.O. Ryan Kimberley,,

211 S Carroll St,28622,Information,0000-000000,2021/10/20 13:00:00+00,,,,"<strong>Madison receives community violence intervention and de-escalation federal grants</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
(MADISON, Wis.)—The Madison Police Department (MPD) has received two community policing grants from the Office of Community Oriented Policing, U.S. Department of Justice (COPS Office), announced Chief of Police Shon. F. Barnes. “We are grateful to be given this opportunity to develop and implement promising and creative approaches to preventing crime and promoting safety in our community,” he said.<br />
<br />
A Community Violence Intervention: Breaking the Cycle of Youth Violence grant award of $125,000 will fund a youth wraparound services pilot project through partner RISE Wisconsin, Inc., a local community-based organization, to break the cycle of youth from the same families committing violent crimes though providing wraparound resources to repeat juvenile offenders and family members.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;“Many youth arrested for violent crimes have siblings that are already behind in literacy and numeracy skills and may have unaddressed trauma-related issues. Because siblings live in the same environments as their arrested siblings, we believe a focused intervention with the offenders and siblings may assist in reducing their likelihood to follow that same criminal path, and may also help lower offender recidivism,” said Capt. Mike Hanson, the project leader.<br />
<br />
In addition, this plan also includes specific adult intervention for those who also reside with the arrested youth. “Adults in need of services for AODA, employment, housing, trauma and education will also receive wraparound services directly in the home,” said Scott Strong, executive director of RISE.<br />
<br />
A De-escalation Training for Law Enforcement Agencies grant award of $126,420 will help MPD Training Center efforts to build and maintain its officers’ de-escalation proficiency through a USDOJ-approved, nationally certified de-escalation train-the-trainer course and upgraded virtual reality equipment that will be used to train MPD officers for years to come.<br />
<br />
“MPD continues to pursue strategic investments in improving our approach to policing and crime prevention,” said Mayor Rhodes-Conway, “These federal grants will support advanced de-escalation training to help resolve situations without violence, and provide wrap-around resources to families of repeat juvenile offenders to support them.”<br />
<br />
U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin supported both grant applications to the COPS Office Community Policing Development program, which awarded more than $33 million nationally in funding to advance the practice of community policing in law enforcement. “I applaud the Department of Justice for awarding this grant funding to the Madison Police Department,” said Senator Baldwin. “I supported this federal funding because it will promote safety in our community. These grants will help to establish training, resources and relationships to foster mutual trust and positive, productive police interactions that will help prevent crime and violence.”<br />

809 S. Thompson Dr.,28794,Fraud,2022-075732,2022/02/28 20:53:00+00,,,,"On 2/28/2022, a&nbsp;citizen reported that they had likely been the victim of a phone fraud scam when someone claiming to be a federal agent called them to advise their bank accounts had been compromised. That fraudster sent the victim photographs of a fake badge and credentials to convince the victim of their (false) law enforcement status. The fraudster used some common techniques to convince the victim to purchase multiple thousands of dollars’ worth of gift cards and then share the gift card data via text message. The gift cards balances were depleted shortly thereafter. A short time later, the same victim received another phone call from someone falsely claiming to be a Madison police officer who was able to mimic the dispatch phone number so it appeared the phone call was legitimate.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The scam described above is one of many common fraud techniques that citizens experience across the country on a daily basis, both over the phone and online. Below are some tips to help you identify some red flags, which may help you avoid finding yourself in a similar situation:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-Consider third-party confirmation of information like officers’ names and incident report numbers. This can help you confirm whether or not you have spoken to a real law enforcement officer; and can be done simply, with a call to your local non-emergency dispatcher or by directly contacting the agency the suspected fraudster is claiming to be from.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-Gift cards are never a legitimate way to resolve any government-related financial obligations, and any suggestion otherwise should be considered suspicious.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-When selling personal belongings or goods in online marketplaces, be weary of potential buyers with&nbsp;new accounts and profiles. Also, be on the lookout when potential buyers create a manufactured sense of urgency when it comes to shipping the goods, when they offer you more than the price you’re asking, and when they try to suggest a payment transaction method that is more complicated than necessary. These three tactics are often employed together and will leave a victim without their goods and without payment.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-Fraudsters will often target online social apps and websites, and will spend time developing rapport with their victims before convincing them to send money. They oftentimes create that sense of urgency to get their victims to pay large amounts of money. Be cautious about persons you meet online until you’re confident you know exactly who they are.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-Law enforcement will never call you to tell you have a warrant for your arrest and to demand a monetary payment to resolve the warrant. If you have any questions as to whether or not such a warrant exists, call your local police agency.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

In early May, a suspect broke into several businesses located in the Clock Tower Plaza on Mineral Point Road. This person stole a number of items and caused thousands of dollars in damages to these businesses.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A few days later, a couple arrived to work to find someone had broken into the restaurant they owned. The business had been damaged and more than $10,000 was missing from inside.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
These are just two of the cases that our Burglary Crime Unit investigated.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The investigation, while still on-going, required MPD officers to process and analyze business video, utilize our partners at the Wisconsin State Crime Lab to examine forensic evidence for DNA, and access and investigate cell phone data.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This work has led to the arrest of Tramaine Franklin, 34, of Sun Prairie.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

In June, MPD and other law enforcement partners searched Franklin’s apartment and found more incriminating evidence tying him to these cases.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In July, the Burglary Crime Unit and the MPD Gang and Neighborhood Crime Abatement Team (GNCAT) tracked Franklin to a house on the east side. After extended negotiations, and with the help of his family, Franklin surrendered and was safely taken into custody. At that time, he was charged with several burglaries.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Since then, an additional 11 cases have been submitted for referral to the District Attorney’s Office. This brings the total to 15 commercial burglaries with additional charges for damages done to the victims.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It is estimated that in these cases along, there was over $17,000 in stolen items of value and $20,000 in property damage done. Nearly all of the victims were small, family business owners.<br />

There are ways to protect your property from similar thefts:
<ul>
	<li>Secure your key in a safe place – away from mopeds, motorcycles, ATVs, etc.</li>
	<li>Record serial numbers and take photos of items such as mopeds, bicycles, cameras and laptops in case a theft occurs</li>

	<li>Be mindful of past tendencies of your family member or friend and where they might go, who they know, and what kinds of things they like</li>
	<li>If possible, please be prepared to share how officers can best interact with your loved one when we find them. What is helpful for them, and what is not? These things can help us thoughtfully tailor our response</li>

The individual often later finds that either the property does not exist (or is unavailable for rent), or the person with whom they’ve been speaking neither owns nor manages the property.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Preventative Tips:<br />
1. Make contact in-person if possible. This will allow you to see the apartment and review the lease with the property manager.<br />
2. Be mindful of the area code. If the phone number isn't a 608 area code, it is likely not a property manager within the city of Madison.<br />
3. Attempt to only make contact with property managers and individuals whom are authorized to lease an apartments by using online reviews or company websites to verify.<br />
4. Remember to be mindful of the price the apartment is listed for and compare it to market value.<br />
5. You can report these types of incidents directly to the Federal Trade Commission as they often cross state lines.<br />
7. Fraudsters will often target online social apps and websites, and will spend time developing rapport with their victims before convincing them to send money. They often times create that sense of urgency to get their victims to pay large amounts of money. Be cautious about persons you meet online until you're confident you know exactly who they are.<br />

The crash occurred when a stolen vehicle struck a citizen’s vehicle. As a result, the operator of the stolen vehicle lost control and ultimately came to a stop. No injuries were reported as a result of this motor vehicle accident.<br />

211 S. Carroll St.,30162,Fraud,2022-000000,2022/11/09 20:00:00+00,,,,"Recently, there has been an uptick in scams targeting elderly victims. This increasing trend has been seen in our community and others, and has many different forms.<br />
<br />
These scams take many forms, but are typically seen when the intended victim receives a call from someone pretending to be their grandchild or a loved one. The “grandchild,” in reality is the scammer, and often times will sound panicked and will be asking for help. The scammer will claim that they’ve been in a car accident, have been arrested, or were the victim of some kind of crime. The scammer will then ask for money, usually with a demand that the victim deliver this immediately and not talk to anyone about the situation.<br />
<br />
We have seen situations lately where the scammers will ask for cash, and send a “courier,” to collect the cash. Other circumstances will ask for bank or credit card information. MPD has also dealt with circumstances where the scammer asks for the victim to go to a Bitcoin ATM and complete a transaction that way.<br />
<br />
The Madison Police Department wants to remind the community of some general safety tips related to identification and prevention of these scams.
<ul>
	<li>If you are receiving a phone call from a number that you don’t know and the person on the other end claims to be a relative, it is ok to hang up and try to reach that relative at a known phone number. This pause can save you the headache of being scammed!</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>If someone is claiming to be in legal trouble or at a jail, ask them which jail or facility they are at. Then, make a phone call to verify if that is the case by contacting that jail/law enforcement agency directly!</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>If someone asks you to complete a financial transaction at a Bitcoin ATM or other similar ATM, and this is out of the ordinary, stop and verify all information before doing so. Make calls to the person you believe is asking for money, and make sure you know the implications of such transactions.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>Remember, no government official will ask you to pay fines or fees with gift cards from Amazon, Target, or any other store. If you have been directed to purchase these items, do not read off the codes for the cards to anyone over the phone.?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>Do not give out personally identifying information, such as a bank account number or Social Security Number to a person or website you don’t know and trust.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<br />
The scam was reported to MPD around 1:15 p.m. on Monday.<br />
<br />
A woman received phone calls, emails and text messages from someone pretending to be a Chinese police officer. The fake officer instructed her to pay the money due to her involvement in a criminal investigation.<br />
<br />
The woman tried to send the money, but thankfully her bank flagged the transaction as suspicious.<br />
<br />
This type of scam typically targets the foreign student population and often results in large financial losses. Scammers are also known to impersonate the IRS, Medicare, the Federal Trade Commission, doctors and your grandkids.<br />
<br />
In these situations, scammers may know your name, mention the call is being recorded, claim you’ve missed a court appearance and tell you to take action immediately to avoid being arrested.<br />
<br />
The best way to avoid being fooled is to never send money to strangers.&nbsp; Law enforcement agencies will never ask you to purchase bitcoin, gift cards or wire money as part of their investigations.<br />
<br />
MPD also advises against sharing information like your address, social security number or bank account information to strangers over the phone.<br />
<br />
And do not give in to the pressure. Scammers have been known to try and threaten people. If you ever find yourself in this situation, please reach you to your local agency’s non-emergency number, independently. &nbsp;",PIO Stephanie Fryer,,

A woman received a call from a scammer pretending to be an MPD sergeant Thursday night. The scammer told the woman she missed a court hearing and needed to pay $7,000 because she was “in contempt of court.”<br />

The woman realized this was fake and hung up. She then immediately reported the incident to police.<br />

The Madison Police Department does not call individuals and demand or request money from community members under any circumstances.<br />

MPD, along with other legitimate law enforcement agencies, will never call community members seeking payment for outstanding traffic citations or warrants. This includes claims of unpaid federal or state taxes.<br />
<br />
Below is a list of tips to help avoid becoming a victim to this type of scam:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Never give personal or financial information to an unsolicited caller or email.</li>
	<li>Be suspicious of callers who demand immediate payment for any reason.</li>
	<li>Stay private. Regularly update privacy settings for social media sites. Scammers often make their stories more believable by trolling for personal information on Facebook, Twitter and similar sites.&nbsp;</li>

<br />
The purpose of the campaign is to remind motorists about the importance of seatbelt use, enforce the life-saving habit of wearing a seatbelt and reduce the number of fatalities that occur when drivers and passengers fail to buckle up.&nbsp; Wisconsin’s primary seatbelt law allows law enforcement to stop and cite motorists for failing to wear a seatbelt. Drivers can also be cited for every unbuckled passenger in their vehicle.<br />
<br />
Not wearing a seatbelt can have tragic consequences.&nbsp; Drivers and passengers who do not wear their seatbelt, are 80 times more likely to be ejected from the vehicle in a crash and eight times more likely to die in a crash.&nbsp; Wearing your seatbelt is one of the easiest and most effective steps you can take to survive a crash.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Wisconsin’s seatbelt use is dropping and failure to fasten a seatbelt is among the most common traffic violations in Wisconsin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

The goal of these extra patrols is not only to enhance public safety, but to also educate citizens and to prevent needless tragedies.

<ul>
	<li>Bicycles, according to WI Statute, are considered vehicles. They have the same rights on the roadways as motor vehicles and they must obey the rules of the road like any other vehicle.</li>
	<li>Motorists should leave at least three feet when passing bicycles, more room at higher speeds.&nbsp; They should change lanes to pass any bicycle traveling, if possible.</li>
	<li>Motorists should look for bicycles in the opposing lane to them before they turn left. &nbsp;The most common cause of bicycle crashes is a motorist making a left turn across the path of an oncoming bicycle.</li>
	<li>Motorists should scan sidewalks and crosswalks for pedestrians and bicyclists.&nbsp; They must yield to pedestrians who have started crossing at an intersection or crosswalk.&nbsp; Motorists must also yield to pedestrians who have started crossing a roadway, within a marked or an unmarked crosswalk, at an intersection not controlled by traffic signals.</li>
	<li>Motorists should always look for bicyclists and pedestrians to their right side before they leave a stop light or stop sign. They should also look to the left and right side sidewalks when they are on a one-way street.</li>

&nbsp;<br />
This summer, the Madison Police Department will be conducting extra patrols that will focus on enforcing Wisconsin’s bicycle and pedestrian laws.&nbsp; These additional enforcement efforts are made possible through traffic overtime grants provided by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.<br />
<br />
The goal of these extra patrols is not only to enhance public safety, but to also educate citizens and to prevent needless tragedies. Throughout the past five years in Wisconsin, there have been 10,737 pedestrians and bicyclists crashes, resulting in 9799 injuries and 336 deaths.&nbsp; In 2022 alone, 1,378 pedestrians and 679 bicyclists in Wisconsin were involved in motor vehicle crashes, resulting in 74 and 14 deaths, respectively.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bicycles, according to WI Statute, are considered vehicles. They have the same rights on the roadways as motor vehicles and they must obey the rules of the road like any other vehicle.<br />
<br />
Motorists should leave at least three feet when passing bicycles, more room at higher speeds.&nbsp; They should change lanes to pass any bicycle traveling, if possible.<br />
<br />
Motorists should look for bicycles in the opposing lane to them before they turn left. &nbsp;The most common cause of bicycle crashes is a motorist making a left turn across the path of an oncoming bicycle.<br />
<br />
Motorists should scan sidewalks and crosswalks for pedestrians and bicyclists.&nbsp; They must yield to pedestrians who have started crossing at an intersection or crosswalk.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Motorists must also yield to pedestrians who have started crossing a roadway, within a marked or an unmarked crosswalk, at an intersection not controlled by traffic signals.<br />
<br />
Motorists should always look for bicyclists and pedestrians to their right side before they leave a stop light or stop sign. They should also look to the left and right side sidewalks when they are on a one-way street.<br />
<br />
Pedestrians should not suddenly move into the path of a closely approaching vehicle that does not have sufficient time to yield for them.<br />
<br />
The Madison Police Department needs your help to make our roads safer for EVERYONE. &nbsp;Distracted driving, walking or biking can cause grave danger to you and anyone else on the road.&nbsp; Please obey all traffic laws, focus on the road, be aware of others and pay attention to your surroundings and potential dangers when you are driving, biking or walking.&nbsp;",Lt.

&nbsp;<br />
This summer, the Madison Police Department will be conducting extra patrols that will focus on enforcing Wisconsin’s bicycle and pedestrian laws.&nbsp; These additional enforcement efforts are made possible through traffic overtime grants provided by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.<br />
<br />
The goal of these extra patrols is not only to enhance public safety, but to also educate citizens and to prevent needless tragedies. Throughout the past five years in Wisconsin, there have been 10,737 pedestrians and bicyclists crashes, resulting in 9799 injuries and 336 deaths.&nbsp; In 2022 alone, 1,378 pedestrians and 679 bicyclists in Wisconsin were involved in motor vehicle crashes, resulting in 74 and 14 deaths, respectively.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bicycles, according to WI Statute, are considered vehicles. They have the same rights on the roadways as motor vehicles and they must obey the rules of the road like any other vehicle.
<ul>
	<li>Motorists should leave at least three feet when passing bicycles, more room at higher speeds.&nbsp; They should change lanes to pass any bicycle traveling, if possible.</li>
	<li>Motorists should look for bicycles in the opposing lane to them before they turn left. &nbsp;The most common cause of bicycle crashes is a motorist making a left turn across the path of an oncoming bicycle.</li>
	<li>Motorists should scan sidewalks and crosswalks for pedestrians and bicyclists.&nbsp; They must yield to pedestrians who have started crossing at an intersection or crosswalk.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Motorists must also yield to pedestrians who have started crossing a roadway, within a marked or an unmarked crosswalk, at an intersection not controlled by traffic signals.</li>
	<li>Motorists should always look for bicyclists and pedestrians to their right side before they leave a stop light or stop sign. They should also look to the left and right side sidewalks when they are on a one-way street.</li>
	<li>Pedestrians should not suddenly move into the path of a closely approaching vehicle that does not have sufficient time to yield for them.</li>

Every 39 minutes in the United States, one person is killed in a drunk driving crash. More than 13,000 lives are lost each year.&nbsp; December is a particularly deadly month, especially during the holidays.&nbsp;<br />

This year, from December 13, 2023 through January 1, 2024, the Madison Police Department and the Dane County Sheriff’s Department are taking part in the Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over campaign.&nbsp; The goals of this campaign are to educate people about the dangers and consequences of driving drunk, decrease impaired driving, prevent needless tragedies and save lives.<br />
<br />
But, we cannot do it alone.&nbsp; We need your help to make our roads safer.&nbsp; If you are celebrating and drinking this holiday season, always remember to have a plan to get home safely.&nbsp; Just one drink before driving can put you and others in danger, because alcohol impairs thinking, reasoning and muscle coordination.
<ul>
	<li>Always drive 100% sober. Even one alcoholic beverage could be one too many. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Plan ahead: Before you have even one drink, designate a sober driver to get you home safely.</li>
	<li>You have options to get home safely: designate a sober driver or call a taxi or rideshare. Getting home safely is always worth it.</li>
	<li>If it’s your turn to be the designated driver, take your job seriously and don’t drink.</li>
	<li>If you have a friend who is about to drink and drive, take the keys away and let a sober driver get your friend home safely.&nbsp;</li>

	<li>Approximately 76,000 pedestrians and 47,000 bicyclists are injured in roadway crashes annually in the United States.</li>
	<li>Speeding is a contributing factor in approximately 30% of all traffic fatalities in the United States.</li>

<ul>
	<li>On average, every day, twenty pedestrians are killed by a moving vehicle in the United States.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pedestrian deaths have been climbing since 2010 - primarily due to motorists who drive recklessly and aggressively, speed and are distracted.</li>
	<li>Pedestrian and bicyclist deaths make up approximately 20% of all traffic-related fatalities in the United States.</li>
	<li>Approximately 76,000 pedestrians and 47,000 bicyclists are injured in roadway crashes annually in the United States.</li>
	<li>Speeding is a contributing factor in approximately 30% of all traffic fatalities in the United States.</li>
	<li>Someone is injured or killed in an impaired driving crash every two hours in Wisconsin.</li>
	<li>Thousands of unbuckled passenger vehicle occupants are killed every year in crashes throughout the United States.</li>

<ul>
	<li>On average, every day, twenty pedestrians are killed by a moving vehicle in the United States.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pedestrian deaths have been climbing since 2010 - primarily due to motorists who drive recklessly and aggressively, speed and are distracted.</li>
	<li>Pedestrian and bicyclist deaths make up approximately 20% of all traffic-related fatalities in the United States.</li>
	<li>Approximately 76,000 pedestrians and 47,000 bicyclists are injured in roadway crashes annually in the United States.</li>
	<li>Speeding is a contributing factor in approximately 30% of all traffic fatalities in the United States.</li>

<br />
?The Madison Police Department will be joining law enforcement agencies across Wisconsin and the United States in stepping up the enforcement of seatbelt laws.&nbsp;The high-visibility&nbsp;Click It or Ticket&nbsp;seatbelt campaign, which coincides with the beginning of the busy summer travel season, runs from May 20 through June 2, 2024.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The purpose of the campaign is to remind motorists about the importance of seatbelt use, enforce the life-saving habit of wearing a seatbelt, and reduce the number of fatalities that occur when drivers and passengers fail to buckle up.&nbsp; Wisconsin’s primary seatbelt law allows law enforcement to stop and cite motorists for failing to wear a seatbelt. Drivers can also be cited for every unbuckled passenger in their vehicle.<br />
<br />
Wearing your seatbelt is one of the easiest and most effective steps you can take to survive a crash.&nbsp; If you know a friend or a family member who does not buckle up when they drive, please ask them to consider changing their habits. Help us spread this lifesaving message before one more friend or family member is killed as a result of this senseless inaction. Seat belts save lives, and everyone — front seat and back, child and adult — needs to remember to buckle up.<br />

In reviewing reports on this incident, it sounds like victims are being greeted with a popup in their banking software telling them that a transfer of funds has been validated to a possible illicit activity, accusing the victim of engaging in illegal activity. The pop-up also has a phone number to call.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Once the number has been called, victims report being transferred to other phone lines or being asked to wait on calls. After being on the phone, they are asked to drain money from their accounts in order to transfer it to another individual so that the initial fraud could be investigated. Once all the money from their account is drained out, victims are being encouraged to purchase gold and to transfer that money.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Madison Police Department is aware of these cases and is actively investigating them. To keep your accounts safe, the Madison Police Department recommends:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Be cautious of any entity asking you to quickly transfer funds over the phone.<br />
If you see suspicious activity on your accounts, report it to your banking entity.<br />
Remember that law enforcement will not ask for funds in exchange for us to investigate a crime or alleged fraud.<br />
Take time to conduct internet searches of numbers given by these pop ups to see if they are legitimate.<br />
If someone is claiming you transferred funds from your account, take the time to independently verify if this occurred (logging onto your bank account or contacting your local branch).<br />

The male subject fled when the first officer approached him, but was apprehended by another officer coming into the area.&nbsp; Three officers attempted to maintain control of the subject as he fought with them and resisted their attempts to place him in handcuffs.&nbsp; Officers made multiple attempts to deploy Electronic Control Devices to subdue the subject as he fought them and disregarded their commands, but the male subject was able to free himself and again fled on foot.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

As more officers came into the area to help, the subject was cornered and additional officers attempted to wrestle him into custody.&nbsp; Further deployments of Electronic Control Devices were used and a total of seven officers were required to get the man into restraints.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

Four officers were treated at a local hospital for minor injuries consisting of abrasions, bruises and a facial laceration.&nbsp; Even after chemical sedation at the hospital, the suspect was resistive and required extra officers to assist with the transport.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
