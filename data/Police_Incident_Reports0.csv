April 16th)

(UPDATED Monday, April 14, 2008)

The Madison Police Department is seeking additional information from people who were in the Bassett Neighborhood either on the day Brittany was killed, or on the day before her death. Specifically, detectives would like to speak with anyone who was solicited for money – or gave money to strangers - on either April 1st or April 2nd.  This would include citizens who were approached on the street, or at their homes, by one or more individuals. Investigators are focusing this effort on solicitations that were made on West Washington Ave., West Main St., West Wilson St., South Bedford St., South Bassett St., or West Doty Street.  The MPD would ask those with information to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.


(UPDATED FRIDAY APRIL 11, 2008)

Posters seeking information in the Brittany Sue Zimmermann case will soon be posted by Madison Police Officers in the Bassett Neighborhood, and in other areas of the central city. A copy of the poster has been attached to this incident report. 

Madison Crime Stoppers has now received approximately 200 tips in the Zimmermann case. In addition, some 25 new tips have come in reference the Joel Marino homicide. Joel was murdered on January 28th, and prior to Brittany’s homicide around 70 tips had been received in the Marino investigation.

There are some similarities in the cases. Both residents were killed inside their homes, during daylight hours, and no motive has been established in either case. There appears to be nothing in either victim’s background that would make them targets of violence. 

Still, investigators do not know if the cases are connected, and there are differences. For example, in the Zimmermann case there were signs of forced entry. There was no evidence of forced entry in the Marino case. 

Both Marino and Zimmermann lived in close proximity, perhaps a mile or so apart. Because of the closeness detectives working the Marino case are coming across information that may help the Zimmermann case. Conversely, detectives working the Zimmermann case are coming across information that may aid the Marino probe.

Both cases remain very active investigations.





(UPDATED MONDAY APRIL 7)

Some members of the media have been inquiring about a man who was going to various locations in the downtown (including a residence on West Washington Avenue) soliciting money from residents on the day of Brittany's death. This person is in custody on a probation hold, and is one of many who have been arrested (for things like probation holds and unrelated crimes) during the Zimmermann investigation. No suspect has been identified in the murder of Brittany. Detectives are continuing to pursue a plethora of leads. The MPD appreciates all of those who have come forward with information, and encourages others to call Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014 as this remains a very active investigation. 

(UPDATED PRESS INFORMATION: RELEASED FRIDAY APRIL 4, 2008)

The Madison Police Department, with assistance from the WI State Crime Laboratory, continued Friday to process the home of Brittany Sue Zimmermann. 

Forensic analysts at the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison are already expediting the examination of some items found that may have evidentiary value.

Meanwhile, the focus of the investigation continues on several fronts. Patrol officers and detectives have been talking with numerous people in the neighborhood including residents, commuters, business owners, and transients.   Police are seeking to speak with those who are willing to share information, and those who may be somewhat reluctant to contact police directly.   Police seek any information regarding activity in the area.   

In the Zimmermann case, the MPD would like citizens to focus on the daytime – going into the nighttime hours -- of Wednesday April 2nd.   If anyone saw anything odd, strange, or out of the ordinary in the area of the crime scene—a call to Crime Stoppers (608-266-6014) would be appreciated.

In the last 24 hours more than 75 tips have come in to Crime Stoppers. Many of those calls are from people who have had strangers come to their doors, or into their homes recently, or over the course of the past several months. Several callers said at the time they did not call police. The MPD would urge anyone, at anytime, encountering a similar situation to call. 

Other tips in the Zimmermann investigation have come from downtown residents who saw people going door to door asking for money on the day of the homicide. In at least one case a man entered a residence. Investigators have identified many of these people, and have talked with them. It is not unusual during such contacts that arrests are made for unrelated matters. For instance, some contacts are made with those who may have outstanding warrants, or are wanted on probation holds.

At this hour the MPD does not have a suspect, or suspects identified in the Zimmermann homicide.  The Dane County Coroner has determined Brittany died from a “complexity of traumatic injuries.”  Investigators have not established a motive. 

Madison and UW police officers will continue increased foot patrols in the Bassett Street Neighborhood.









(UPDATED THURSDAY APRIL 3 @ 12:20 p.m.)

Investigators in the Brittany Zimmermann homicide have concluded that her boyfriend is not a suspect in this case. 

He has been -- and continues to be -- very helpful in providing information to the detective team.

Many leads have come in, and detectives are pursuing them. No suspect has been identified.

The search of Brittany's home -- and the area around it -- continues.  Items of possible evidentiary value are being taken to the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory in Madison for analysis.

A member of the Dane County's Victim/Witness unit is working with Brittany's family. She will be keeping them posted on developments in the case, and has informed the MPD that the family is asking for privacy as they continue to grieve.

A good number of tips have come in to the MPD, and citizens with any information that may help lead to an arrest are encouraged to continue to call the Madison Police Crime Stoppers line at 608-266-6014.

(ORIGINAL RELEASE)
Shortly after 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday Madison Police were called to a residence in the 500 block of West Doty Street to check on a person. Ms. Zimmermann was found dead inside her home. Dane County Coroner John Stanley says a preliminary examination indicates the manner of death was homicide. 

The Madison Police Department is working in unison with the UW-Madison Police Department on this case, and a Command Post has been established inside the Central District station.

Both Madison Police Chief Noble Wray, and UW Police Chief Susan Riseling have pledged extra patrols, and a heightened presence on Doty Street and surrounding areas for the time being.

At this writing no suspects have been identified, and detectives have been unable to rule out that this may have been a random act.

District Alderman Mike Verveer is looking to hold a community meeting this weekend to address concerns of residents.

Meanwhile, a team of detectives will work the case around the clock, with patrol officers aiding in their efforts.

Coroner Stanley has indicated a forensic examination will be done tomorrow morning at which time he may (or may not -- depending on consultation with investigators) release more information on the cause of death.

""This terrible crime is a tragedy, and my thoughts are with the victim's family and friends,"" said Mayor Dave Cieslewicz.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the same time, a woman was reporting a missing dog, a German Shepherd named Anika. She’s nine-years-old, and belongs to the woman’s father. He was in the hospital for surgery, and she was carrying for Anika, until Tuesday, when Anika bolted out of an open door. The owner’s daughter and a friend spent the better part of the night searching, but to no avail.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the daughter was working with the officers. A MPD drone operator was brought in, but power lines prevented good aerial surveillance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point, the daughter needed to drop from the search party in order to go pick up her dad, who was being discharged.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During her absence, officers continued the hunt, finally spotting Anika down by a creek. They kept a close eye on her for over an hour, but did not want to too close for fear of spooking Anika again.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jaguar, stolen out of Monona, was initially spotted by police Tuesday in an E. Springs Dr. parking lot. The driver sped away from the MPD.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witnesses reported seeing the high-end convertible going an estimated 100 mph, running red lights on Northport Dr. It caught a lot of attention, with many assuming it was stolen: “There’s no way the owners are driving like that,” one witness later told the MPD.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several provided good descriptions of the suspects, with one man showing an officer their direction of travel.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parker-Needham was wearing a court-ordered GPS ankle bracelet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As officers tried to determine why the suspects gave up the Jaguar, wondering if it had been in a collision, Culver said: “It’s not damaged. It is out of gas.”<br />

&nbsp;<br />
Later in the evening, a group gathered at the top of State Street on the Capital Square to protest.&nbsp; The group grew during the evening.&nbsp; MPD elected not to engage the protest and allow for the First Amendment expression to continue.&nbsp; During the protest, some acts of graffiti occurred, and numerous items (barricades, construction fences, etc.) were moved into the roadway.<br />

Shortly before 1am the formal gathering ended and the crowd began to disperse.&nbsp; Large groups immediately began moving down State Street, engaging in looting, graffiti, and property damage. One subject fired multiple shots in the air from a handgun, and two individuals were attacked and struck with a crowbar. Individuals were also observed attempting to light Molotov cocktails during the evening. Officers in protective gear deployed to State Street as a result of this behavior.&nbsp; Multiple officers were struck with rocks and projectiles as they moved to secure the street.&nbsp; Chemical agents were utilized in response.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For the third straight night, a number of individuals have come downtown not for the purpose of First Amendment expression, but to engage in violence, looting and property damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;15 arrests were made during the night.&nbsp; MPD is grateful to the many outside law enforcement agencies and National Guard personnel who assisted.<br />

26577,Information,2020-000000,2020/06/02 06:00:00+00,,,100 block State Street,,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was unexpected, but yet an oh-so welcome peace offering, considering these turbulent and divisive times, and it came from an organizer of last night’s protest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A MPD Special Events Team (SET) was away from the gathering on State Capitol grounds, giving people space to exercise their First Amendment rights. The team was ready to deploy to State Street, should looting and other violence erupt again. The following is an account from one of its members:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We formed a line in front of Grace Episcopal Church, when we were approached by three protesters. As I recall, two were black men, and one was a black woman. The woman informed SET that the peaceful protest was over, and she was leaving. She went on to tell us that she would go down to the top of State Street, encourage the group to leave, and inform them that the protest was over. The woman made clear that whoever remained would know that their decision could carry a consequence. The woman then&nbsp;headed down to the top of State Street, and I could hear&nbsp;her voice in what I understood to be an attempt to speak with the group. The woman returned back to our position, and she wished SET a safe night.&nbsp;Her group also handed out flowers to SET officers, and I do not know an officer who turned the offer down. Many officers carried the flowers on them during the subsequent clear of State Street (after looting broke out).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, this week has been extremely challenging for so many. I thought it was incredibly brave for these three individuals to approach the police, and offer a gesture of kindness. This demonstrated to me what almost all of us recognize - many of those in the crowd wish to lawfully&nbsp;express their constitutional liberties, and only a small group of people are causing the chaos we have seen. SET is absolutely committed to protecting lawful protest, and this commitment is why I joined the team.&nbsp;Unfortunately, SET's responsibilities to public safety limit our ability&nbsp;to engage in a&nbsp;conversation about what is happening&nbsp;while in hard gear, but many SET officers noted how remarkable and kind this moment was.”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This story will likely not make headline news, but for those looking for glimmers of hope, they are out there, on our streets: in this case protesters and police sharing moments of humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

The child had been playing inside a third floor room at the GrandStay Hotel and Suites, 5317 High Crossing Blvd., when he evidently leaned hard into a window screen, causing it to detach. He fell to grass below. It appeared he had a broken arm and he said he hurt “all over.” He was taken to a hospital with what are believed to be non-life-threatening injuries.",PIO Joel Despain,
26608,Information,2020-207503,2020/06/10 02:00:00+00,,,2900 block Industrial Drive,,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time of year, females can move relatively long distances. It is egg laying time, and the hunt for new habitat is instinctual, yet often times dangerous.<br />
Such was the case last Tuesday night on Industrial Drive. By the time an officer arrived, it appeared a slow moving snapping turtle, which was in the roadway, had just escaped certain death. Its shell was freshly scraped, and it appeared a passing car’s undercarriage had caused damage, but no serious injury.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer attempted to encourage the turtle’s forward progress by pushing it with a police baton. However, snapping turtles are known for having rather combative dispositions, and true to form, this one responded by looking at the officer while repeatedly opening and shutting its powerful beak-like jaws.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The turtle was also very heavy to just push,” noted the officer. She next attempted to get it on top of a plastic sheet, with thoughts of pulling it across rain-slicked pavement. “However the turtle’s claws were very sharp and ripped up the plastic sheet,” said the officer. It was time for backup: “I do not have experience with moving a large snapping turtle, so I requested assistance.”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for an officer with a more extensive wildlife background, “I tried to use verbal commands to get the turtle to move across the road. However, the turtle continued to assess me as a threat and kept trying to snap/bite in my direction.”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the second officer arrived, he explained you need to move a snapping turtle by lifting it with two hands, just above the rear legs, but not by the turtle’s tail as that can cause spinal damage.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, the hoist was made. The turtle was now making rapid progress on its journey, yet continued to show displeasure with human contact.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may have been unwanted, but the initial officer was very pleased with the outcome of the safe passage, writing in her report: “Hopefully the turtle will continue to live a long snappy life.”<br />
She decided to name it for its behavior and home turf: “Snappy the South Side Turtle”<br />

26640,Injured Person,2020-227434,2020/06/24 06:00:00+00,,,300 block State Street,,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MPD is investigating an assault on an 18-year-old bi-racial woman as a hate crime after she was burned with lighter fluid early Wednesday morning.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The victim believes she was driving on W. Gorham St. when she stopped for a red light at State St. Her driver’s side window was down and she heard someone yell out a racial epithet. She looked and saw four men, all white. She says one used a spray bottle to deploy a liquid on her face and neck, and then threw a flaming lighter at her, causing the liquid to ignite.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She drove forward, patted out the flames, and eventually drove home. Her mother encouraged her to go to a hospital.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospital staff believed the liquid was lighter fluid. She was treated for burns, and will need to make follow-up visits to access additional medical care.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigators are looking at surveillance images to see if any of the assault was captured on camera.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone with information on this crime is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014 or by computer at P3Tips.com<br />

Main St.,,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MPD has now been able to make contact with a state politician who was attacked and beaten by an angry mob late Tuesday night, or early Wednesday morning. The victim’s name has been widely reported by media, but it is the protocol of the MPD not to identify crime victims.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The politician said he was walking to the State Capitol around midnight when he saw a group of demonstrators in the street. He decided to use his phone to capture what was happening. As he did, three people rushed toward him, saying something about his phone. One knocked it out of his hand. He said he was then sucker punched. He fell to the ground and was battered by several people.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A media member, who witnessed the assault, told police approximately ten people punched and kicked the politician while he was on the ground and as the politician tried to explain that he is an ally.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the beating stopped, the politician tried to dialogue with his attackers, explaining who he was, and asking for his phone and glasses to be returned. They were, and someone identifying herself as a nurse came to his aid.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling “lightheaded, stunned and dazed” he next stumbled toward the State Capitol, where he laid down on the grass.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made contact with Capitol Police who called for an emergency medical response. Paramedics treated the politician, but he declined to go to a hospital.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capitol Police escorted him into the Capitol, and told him not to leave the building because of property damage and unruly behavior that was continuing to take place outside.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The politician later sought medical help at a hospital. He told the MPD he was still feeling pain in his neck, arms, ribs, and head.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MPD is working on identifying the politician’s attackers. Anyone with information is urged to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014 or by computer at P3Tips.com<br />

The neighbor, and the nurse, reported all of this to an officer who was called to the scene.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several hours later, just before noon, the neighbor was calling 911 again. He was now at Brittingham Park and, lo and behold, there was the suspect sitting on a bench with the nurse’s bike right next to it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an officer arrived, the suspect provided a fake name, and said he had just gotten to Madison 15 days prior from Havana, Cuba via the Chicago Area. The bike, he said, he bought from a guy for ten bucks.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately for him, there was an eyewitness, the nurse’s neighbor, and the suspect was soon on his way to jail, where he was actually booked in for stealing two bikes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A downtown MPD officer was able to connect Jose A. Lino, age 56, to an earlier theft thanks to surveillance cameras. They had captured Lino taking a 23-year-old man’s bicycle just after midnight on August 24th. The victim had locked it to a rack in the 100 block of State St.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer interviewed Lino at the jail, and Lino admitted to stealing the State St. bike. He said it was now gone. He sold it for ten bucks.<br />

Concerned he might be hit, should a projectile come through a window, the victim summoned the MPD. When officers arrived, they spotted the stone thrower. He was still outside, jumping up and down, and yelling in the direction of the victim’s residence. Officers told him to drop what was in his hands. The suspect replied he currently&nbsp;was grasping&nbsp;only a small rock of crack cocaine, and he did let it go. He explained his behavior, talking about how he was a dissatisfied customer who had come to this home earlier to purchase drugs. He left, smoked some, and concluded it was “crap.” He wanted his money back. Trouble was, the victim assured he had not sold cocaine to this man, ever.

Surveillance video indicates one got out, sneaked up to the victim’s unlocked passenger door, opened it, and took the wallet. The car, occupied by the suspects, is listed as stolen out of Sun Prairie. The theft took place in the early morning hours of September 28th at the Kwik Trip, 7502 Mineral Point Rd. MPD crime analysts indicate this brings to four the number of recent similar thefts at area gas stations. Motorists are urged to lock doors, and roll up windows, while pumping gas.

26962,Residential Burglary,2020-372739,2020/10/06 18:20:00+00,,,600 block N. Frances St.,,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For early October, the weather could not have been finer for an afternoon downtown run. A N. Frances St. resident, a 20-year-old, certainly thought so. Sadly, stretching his legs came with a price. He had not locked his backdoor, and when he arrived home, his wallet was gone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, thanks to the wonderful world of technology, he was able to determine, using his cell phone, that someone was actively using his credit card to purchases, not far away, at Walgreens, 676 State St.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The victim ventured there, and stood behind the suspect in line, watching as he used the victim’s stolen credit card to buy multiple packs of cigarettes. The 20-year-old did not engage the suspect, wanting to stay safe, but did watch as the man headed outside, handing out packs of smokes to friends.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young man continued to follow the suspect, but lost him as he called police.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An officer went to the Walgreens seeking clues. Because the man had purchased cigarettes, he was required to provide a photo ID, and his image was captured on surveillance cameras.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer went back outside, and soon spotted the suspect in the 500 block of State Street. Ronald Watson, age 56, Madison, told the officer he had made some purchases at Walgreens, but &nbsp;did so with a credit card given to him by a guy known downtown as “Shorty.”<br />
“Shorty,” said the suspect, is not allowed in Walgreens, and asked for assistance in buying some items. The officer said the story was not making sense, since Watson was still holding a Walgreens bag containing packs of cigarettes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer also used other surveillance cameras to track Watson to places very near the victim’s apartment, right around the time of the burglary.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watson was arrested for misappropriation of personal identifying materials and felony bail jumping.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Central District officers are aware of an individual who goes by the moniker, “Shorty.” They located and talked with “Shorty,” and “Shorty” said he had nothing to do with any of what Watson was talking about.<br />

The Madison Area has seen several catalytic converter thefts in recent months.&nbsp; Here are a few crime prevention tips:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>If possible, park in well-lit areas and close to building or building entrances.</li>
	<li>Park in a garage, if possible and lock the doors .</li>
	<li>Have the catalytic converter welded to your car's frame, which may make it harder to steal.&nbsp; Also there are several aftermarket items that can be purchased that your certified auto mechanic can install that would prevent or help prevent the theft.</li>
	<li>Consider engraving your vehicle identification number (VIN) on the catalytic converter.&nbsp; This may assist in recovering your catalytic converter if it is stolen.</li>
	<li>Calibrate your Car's alarm to set off when it detects vibration.&nbsp; The suspects in this crime normally use a battery operation reciprocating saw and it creates a lot of noise and vibration when it is being removed.</li>
	<li>If your able to park your vehicle in a way to limit access to the bottom of the vehicle as much as possible.</li>
	<li>Install cameras home or vehicle that would capture the image of the suspect committing the crime.</li>
	<li>Most importantly if you see or hear anything suspicious please notify your local law enforcement as soon as possible.&nbsp;</li>

<strong>What You Can Do to Avoid a Scam</strong><br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>Block unwanted calls and text messages.&nbsp;</strong>Take steps to block unwanted calls and to filter unwanted text messages.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Don’t give your personal or financial information in response to a request that you didn’t expect.</strong>&nbsp;Legitimate organizations won’t call, email, or text to ask for your personal information, like your Social Security, bank account, or credit card numbers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">If you get an email or text message from a company you do business with and you think it’s real, it’s still best not to click on any links. Instead, contact them using a website you know is trustworthy. Or look up their phone number. Don’t call a number they gave you or the number from your caller ID</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Resist the pressure to act immediately.&nbsp;</strong>Legitimate businesses will give you time to make a decision. Anyone who pressures you to pay or give them your personal information is a scammer.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Know how scammers tell you to pay.</strong>&nbsp;Never pay someone who insists you pay with a gift card or by using a money transfer service. And never deposit a check and send money back to someone.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Stop and talk to someone you trust.</strong>&nbsp;Before you do anything else, tell someone — a friend, a family member, a neighbor — what happened. Talking about it could help you realize it’s a scam.</li>

<br />
According to the <a href=""https://www.nicb.org/news/news-releases/catalytic-converter-theft-skyrocketing-nationwide"">National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB)</a>, catalytic converter thefts have been skyrocketing nationwide:
<div style=""margin-left:40px""><em>“Removing a catalytic converter takes only minutes using some basic, readily-available, battery-operated tools from a local hardware store and for the vehicle owner, it’s costly due to the loss of work, finding and paying for alternate transportation and then paying anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 to get your vehicle fixed.” - NICB</em></div>
<br />
The NICB recommends vehicle owners:
<ul>
	<li>Install a catalytic converter anti-theft device. These are available from various manufacturers and can provide a level of security from theft.</li>
	<li>Park fleet vehicles in an enclosed and secured area that is well lit, locked, and alarmed.</li>
	<li>Park personal vehicles in a garage. If not possible and vehicles must be parked in a driveway, consider installing motion sensor security lights. While lights may not provide complete security, it may make some thieves think twice, making them leave the area and your vehicle untouched.</li>
	<li>Call local law enforcement and your insurer should you become the victim of a catalytic converter theft.</li>

<br />
Just as there are rules of the road when driving a car, there are rules of the sky when operating a drone.<br />
<br />
-Always avoid manned aircraft.<br />
-Never operate in a careless or reckless manner.<br />
-Keep your drone within sight. If you use First Person View or similar technology, you must have a visual observer always keep your drone within unaided sight (for example, no binoculars).<br />
-You cannot be a pilot or visual observer for more than one drone operation at a time.<br />
-Do not fly a drone over people unless they are directly participating in the operation.<br />
-Do not operate your drone from a moving vehicle or aircraft unless you are flying your drone over a sparsely populated area and it does not involve the transportation of property for compensation or hire.<br />
<br />
You can fly during daylight (30 minutes before official sunrise to 30 minutes after official sunset, local time) or in twilight if your drone has anti-collision lighting. Minimum weather visibility is three miles from your control station. The maximum allowable altitude is 400 feet above the ground, higher if your drone remains within 400 feet of a structure. Maximum speed is 100 mph (87 knots).<br />

While officers were verbally engaging the occupants, the driver of the vehicle rammed an MPD squad several times and nearly struck a sergeant on scene prior to fleeing the area. Fortunately, no officers sustained any injury during this incident, though the squad car was damaged.<br />

A pursuit was initiated, and the vehicle was able to evade officers due to reckless and high speed driving.

28612,Information,0000-000000,2021/10/14 05:00:00+00,,,1710 Mckenna Blvd,,"The Madison Police Department’s West District share concerns and are especially troubled by the relatively new escalation involving residents being confronted at gunpoint in and around their vehicles and homes. As many of you know, this is the third such incident since August 19th in a relatively small area to the South and West of McKee Rd and Maple Grove Drive. MPD believes that these three cases are related and are being committed by a small group of individuals who are becoming increasingly more brazen. These three cases are also likely related to the extensive property crime spree that took place during the overnight hours of October 5th where MPD took over 40 reports involving forced entry theft from auto, criminal damage to property, and burglaries. Finally, it appears the involved individuals have been associated with weapons offenses in Madison in recent months.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To be clear, this most recent violent person and property crime spree do NOT fit within what is often referred to as crimes of opportunity. When that phrase is used, we are typically referring to unlocked and unoccupied vehicles or persons entering open unoccupied garages. Individuals involved in these cases typically have no plans of interacting with or confronting residents and generally do not engage in a forced entry or property damage. In those cases, we know that the most effective strategy is one of prevention by locking doors and keeping valuable secure and out of public view. Again, this most recent crime spree does not fit this description and no resident behavior or action is to blame for this. We collectively should not expect and should never accept criminals pointing guns at residents to take property by force. This spree is MPD’s number one priority and we will do everything to bring it to an end.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What are West PD and MPD doing?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The crime spree occurring in the South end of the West District (Aldermanic District 7) is being investigated by West PD Detectives along with the Burglary Crime Unit and the Gang Neighborhood Crime Abatement Team. Additionally, related cases are being investigated by the other MPD Districts. MPD is actively working with the Dane County Stolen Auto Workgroup as well as agencies outside of Dane County who have cases with ties to our spree. It is MPD’s hope and expectation that we will have arrests in these cases to report to you all in the coming days. MPD is working with our Criminal Intelligence Section to analyze data to better inform our preventative strategies and to link cases together. While detectives work to identify, locate and arrest the persons responsible, MPD will work to increase presence in the targeted areas. MPD will do this through assigned directed patrols in the overnight hours (known as 4th and 5th Patrol Details). To bolster patrol resources who are likely to get pulled away for other in-progress priority calls for service, West PD is developing a problem-solving initiative and will soon request additional resources to increase police presence in this specific area. This is a short-term intervention and not sustainable over the long run but it is needed at this time.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In general, residents are always encouraged to be alert, vigilant, and to report all suspicious activity to Dane County Dispatch via 911 or the non-emergency dispatch line at 608-255-2345. MPD recommends the following until this spree has abated:<br />
<br />
- The three carjacking cases have occurred between the hours of 11:00 PM and 2:00 AM with residents arriving home to generally empty streets. MPD’s sense at this time is that suspects have a connection to this area of the city and are in the area and looking for an additional vehicle for use in their criminal activities. They appear to be watching for an alone occupant approaching a residence and typically approach immediately as the vehicle comes to a stop. This is likely done in the hope that the vehicle is still unlocked, running, or at least with keys still in the ignition or easily accessible. Be aware of your surroundings as you approach your residence and watch for occupied cars in the area.&nbsp;<br />
- Considering notifying a family member or neighbor of your arrival time and ask for someone to standby with lights on to greet you and see you safely into your residence.<br />
- If you observe suspicious activity as you arrive to the area of your home and feel unsafe exiting your vehicle, remain in your locked car and contact Dane County Dispatch via 911 to request an officer to respond to check the area and confirm your safety.<br />
- If parking in your garage, consider remaining in the car with the car door locked until the garage door is fully down.<br />
- If parking on the street, in a parking lot, or a driveway, pause momentarily after coming to a stop. Keep car doors locked and monitor the area. If being approached by another vehicle, remain in your locked vehicle and consider your route out of the area should you decide that it would be best to drive away out of the area and call for assistance.<br />
- If confronted by an armed person demanding your property, separate yourself from your property, and move slowly away from the armed suspect(s). Your personal safety is the priority in these situations. Protect yourself and do your very best to be the best possible witness you can be to pass along detailed information to the officers who will respond when notified.<br />
- Assess the area around your home for large areas of darkness that can be addressed with additional lighting. Consider parking in the best lit area possible.<br />
- Assess your routines, especially related to returning home in overnight hours of darkness. Give thought to your route home and where you would expect to see parked cars. Watch for occupied parked vehicles or vehicles moving slowly in the neighborhood. If you routinely arrive home between the hours of 11 PM and 2:00 am in the area recently being targeted, consider working with a family member or neighbor to have someone meet you as you arrive with additional exterior lights on.&nbsp;<br />
- As neighborhood associations or apartment complexes, increase information sharing to keep residents aware of updates to this spree and/or new criminal behavior in the area.<br />
<br />
MPD has also received questions about security cameras and whether they are useful to MPD investigations:<br />
- Absolutely. Video collected in these cases is used to build cases against the individuals involved, even if only to establish a timeline of incidents and to link multiple cases together.&nbsp;<br />
- This can be a time-consuming process and can at times overwhelm our resources, especially in the more prolific sprees such as the October 5th forced entry theft from auto spree, but every piece of information helps to complete the picture and move these cases along.<br />
- When you are aware of criminal activity in your neighborhood, check your camera footage for any potentially useful video evidence. If you find something on your camera footage, contact MPD who can then assess whether we will collect it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Crime prevention is everyone's responsibility, and it starts with all of us in the community working in partnership. MPD’s many partnerships and efforts through our neighborhood officers, community policing teams, gang unit, and our community outreach units focus on building and strengthening relationships, especially with our youth. MPD is confident that we will collectively bring this crime spree to an end and the individuals responsible will be held accountable. Your safety is our priority and we will do everything we can to protect you and your property. Citizens are encouraged to reach out to their respective districts with questions or concerns, MPD is willing to arrange a neighborhood meeting at any time upon request.",P.O. Ryan Kimberley,

&nbsp;<br />
(MADISON, Wis.)—The Madison Police Department (MPD) has received two community policing grants from the Office of Community Oriented Policing, U.S. Department of Justice (COPS Office), announced Chief of Police Shon. F. Barnes. “We are grateful to be given this opportunity to develop and implement promising and creative approaches to preventing crime and promoting safety in our community,” he said.<br />
<br />
A Community Violence Intervention: Breaking the Cycle of Youth Violence grant award of $125,000 will fund a youth wraparound services pilot project through partner RISE Wisconsin, Inc., a local community-based organization, to break the cycle of youth from the same families committing violent crimes though providing wraparound resources to repeat juvenile offenders and family members.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;“Many youth arrested for violent crimes have siblings that are already behind in literacy and numeracy skills and may have unaddressed trauma-related issues. Because siblings live in the same environments as their arrested siblings, we believe a focused intervention with the offenders and siblings may assist in reducing their likelihood to follow that same criminal path, and may also help lower offender recidivism,” said Capt. Mike Hanson, the project leader.<br />
<br />
In addition, this plan also includes specific adult intervention for those who also reside with the arrested youth. “Adults in need of services for AODA, employment, housing, trauma and education will also receive wraparound services directly in the home,” said Scott Strong, executive director of RISE.<br />
<br />
A De-escalation Training for Law Enforcement Agencies grant award of $126,420 will help MPD Training Center efforts to build and maintain its officers’ de-escalation proficiency through a USDOJ-approved, nationally certified de-escalation train-the-trainer course and upgraded virtual reality equipment that will be used to train MPD officers for years to come.<br />
<br />
“MPD continues to pursue strategic investments in improving our approach to policing and crime prevention,” said Mayor Rhodes-Conway, “These federal grants will support advanced de-escalation training to help resolve situations without violence, and provide wrap-around resources to families of repeat juvenile offenders to support them.”<br />
<br />
U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin supported both grant applications to the COPS Office Community Policing Development program, which awarded more than $33 million nationally in funding to advance the practice of community policing in law enforcement. “I applaud the Department of Justice for awarding this grant funding to the Madison Police Department,” said Senator Baldwin. “I supported this federal funding because it will promote safety in our community. These grants will help to establish training, resources and relationships to foster mutual trust and positive, productive police interactions that will help prevent crime and violence.”<br />

On the evening of Oct. 4th and into the early morning hours of Oct. 5, Madison PD (largely on the east side and west side of Madison) received reports of more than forty smashed out vehicle windows, with personal property being taken from the damaged vehicles and a car being stolen by what we believe are the same suspects connected to this series of armed carjacking’s.&nbsp;<br />

Thompson Dr.,,"On 2/28/2022, a&nbsp;citizen reported that they had likely been the victim of a phone fraud scam when someone claiming to be a federal agent called them to advise their bank accounts had been compromised. That fraudster sent the victim photographs of a fake badge and credentials to convince the victim of their (false) law enforcement status. The fraudster used some common techniques to convince the victim to purchase multiple thousands of dollars’ worth of gift cards and then share the gift card data via text message. The gift cards balances were depleted shortly thereafter. A short time later, the same victim received another phone call from someone falsely claiming to be a Madison police officer who was able to mimic the dispatch phone number so it appeared the phone call was legitimate.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The scam described above is one of many common fraud techniques that citizens experience across the country on a daily basis, both over the phone and online. Below are some tips to help you identify some red flags, which may help you avoid finding yourself in a similar situation:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-Consider third-party confirmation of information like officers’ names and incident report numbers. This can help you confirm whether or not you have spoken to a real law enforcement officer; and can be done simply, with a call to your local non-emergency dispatcher or by directly contacting the agency the suspected fraudster is claiming to be from.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-Gift cards are never a legitimate way to resolve any government-related financial obligations, and any suggestion otherwise should be considered suspicious.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-When selling personal belongings or goods in online marketplaces, be weary of potential buyers with&nbsp;new accounts and profiles. Also, be on the lookout when potential buyers create a manufactured sense of urgency when it comes to shipping the goods, when they offer you more than the price you’re asking, and when they try to suggest a payment transaction method that is more complicated than necessary. These three tactics are often employed together and will leave a victim without their goods and without payment.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-Fraudsters will often target online social apps and websites, and will spend time developing rapport with their victims before convincing them to send money. They oftentimes create that sense of urgency to get their victims to pay large amounts of money. Be cautious about persons you meet online until you’re confident you know exactly who they are.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
-Law enforcement will never call you to tell you have a warrant for your arrest and to demand a monetary payment to resolve the warrant. If you have any questions as to whether or not such a warrant exists, call your local police agency.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<em>Fifteen years have passed since our beautiful daughter and sister, Kelly Nolan, was tragically taken from us. This day in our lives seems so close and yet so distant. Her legacy of kindness, humor, loyalty and intelligence are remembered daily by all those who loved her. Kelly simply had a beautiful soul, and we thank the Lord for sending her to us, even if for a shortened time. The passage of time in no way diminishes the heinousness of the crime. We are still seeking accountability and answers surrounding our daughter’s death. We know there is someone out there, whether locally or elsewhere, that can shed light on what happened to Kelly during her final moments of life. Moments we were robbed of spending with her. We ask that you contact the Madison, Wisconsin, Police Department with any information you might have. No detail is too small or insignificant. Please tell police what you saw, know, heard or believe happened to Kelly. Those details just might be the information that is needed to solve this crime and bring a small bit of peace to our family. We ask that you be brave. And know coming forward will not be easy. There are ways for you to remain anonymous if you choose. We also want to take a moment to thank the Madison Police Department, who remain dedicated to solving this case and work daily to prevent other innocent young women from becoming victims.

&nbsp;<br />
These are just two of the cases that our Burglary Crime Unit investigated.<br />

The investigation, while still on-going, required MPD officers to process and analyze business video, utilize our partners at the Wisconsin State Crime Lab to examine forensic evidence for DNA, and access and investigate cell phone data.<br />

This work has led to the arrest of Tramaine Franklin, 34, of Sun Prairie.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

In June, MPD and other law enforcement partners searched Franklin’s apartment and found more incriminating evidence tying him to these cases.<br />

In July, the Burglary Crime Unit and the MPD Gang and Neighborhood Crime Abatement Team (GNCAT) tracked Franklin to a house on the east side. After extended negotiations, and with the help of his family, Franklin surrendered and was safely taken into custody. At that time, he was charged with several burglaries.<br />

Since then, an additional 11 cases have been submitted for referral to the District Attorney’s Office. This brings the total to 15 commercial burglaries with additional charges for damages done to the victims.<br />

The individual often later finds that either the property does not exist (or is unavailable for rent), or the person with whom they’ve been speaking neither owns nor manages the property.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Preventative Tips:<br />
1. Make contact in-person if possible. This will allow you to see the apartment and review the lease with the property manager.<br />
2. Be mindful of the area code. If the phone number isn't a 608 area code, it is likely not a property manager within the city of Madison.<br />
3. Attempt to only make contact with property managers and individuals whom are authorized to lease an apartments by using online reviews or company websites to verify.<br />
4. Remember to be mindful of the price the apartment is listed for and compare it to market value.<br />
5. You can report these types of incidents directly to the Federal Trade Commission as they often cross state lines.<br />
7. Fraudsters will often target online social apps and websites, and will spend time developing rapport with their victims before convincing them to send money. They often times create that sense of urgency to get their victims to pay large amounts of money. Be cautious about persons you meet online until you're confident you know exactly who they are.<br />

<br />
These scams take many forms, but are typically seen when the intended victim receives a call from someone pretending to be their grandchild or a loved one. The “grandchild,” in reality is the scammer, and often times will sound panicked and will be asking for help. The scammer will claim that they’ve been in a car accident, have been arrested, or were the victim of some kind of crime. The scammer will then ask for money, usually with a demand that the victim deliver this immediately and not talk to anyone about the situation.<br />
<br />
We have seen situations lately where the scammers will ask for cash, and send a “courier,” to collect the cash. Other circumstances will ask for bank or credit card information. MPD has also dealt with circumstances where the scammer asks for the victim to go to a Bitcoin ATM and complete a transaction that way.<br />
<br />
The Madison Police Department wants to remind the community of some general safety tips related to identification and prevention of these scams.
<ul>
	<li>If you are receiving a phone call from a number that you don’t know and the person on the other end claims to be a relative, it is ok to hang up and try to reach that relative at a known phone number. This pause can save you the headache of being scammed!</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>If someone is claiming to be in legal trouble or at a jail, ask them which jail or facility they are at. Then, make a phone call to verify if that is the case by contacting that jail/law enforcement agency directly!</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>If someone asks you to complete a financial transaction at a Bitcoin ATM or other similar ATM, and this is out of the ordinary, stop and verify all information before doing so. Make calls to the person you believe is asking for money, and make sure you know the implications of such transactions.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>Remember, no government official will ask you to pay fines or fees with gift cards from Amazon, Target, or any other store. If you have been directed to purchase these items, do not read off the codes for the cards to anyone over the phone.?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>Do not give out personally identifying information, such as a bank account number or Social Security Number to a person or website you don’t know and trust.&nbsp;</li>

30366,Fraud,2023-00117885,2023/03/24 01:34:00+00,,,Madison,,"The Madison Police Department is warning the community about a scam where people are pretending to be MPD employees and requesting money to remedy a missed court appearance.<br />
<br />
A woman received a call from a scammer pretending to be an MPD sergeant Thursday night. The scammer told the woman she missed a court hearing and needed to pay $7,000 because she was “in contempt of court.”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The woman realized this was fake and hung up. She then immediately reported the incident to police.<br />
<br />
The Madison Police Department does not call individuals and demand or request money from community members under any circumstances.<br />
<br />
MPD, along with other legitimate law enforcement agencies, will never call community members seeking payment for outstanding traffic citations or warrants. This includes claims of unpaid federal or state taxes.<br />
<br />
Below is a list of tips to help avoid becoming a victim to this type of scam:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Never give personal or financial information to an unsolicited caller or email.</li>
	<li>Be suspicious of callers who demand immediate payment for any reason.</li>
	<li>Stay private. Regularly update privacy settings for social media sites. Scammers often make their stories more believable by trolling for personal information on Facebook, Twitter and similar sites.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />
If you receive a similar call, hang up. Do not provide any of your private information. And contact your local law enforcement agency when possible.",PIO Stephanie Fryer,

<br />
The purpose of the campaign is to remind motorists about the importance of seatbelt use, enforce the life-saving habit of wearing a seatbelt and reduce the number of fatalities that occur when drivers and passengers fail to buckle up.&nbsp; Wisconsin’s primary seatbelt law allows law enforcement to stop and cite motorists for failing to wear a seatbelt. Drivers can also be cited for every unbuckled passenger in their vehicle.<br />
<br />
Not wearing a seatbelt can have tragic consequences.&nbsp; Drivers and passengers who do not wear their seatbelt, are 80 times more likely to be ejected from the vehicle in a crash and eight times more likely to die in a crash.&nbsp; Wearing your seatbelt is one of the easiest and most effective steps you can take to survive a crash.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Wisconsin’s seatbelt use is dropping and failure to fasten a seatbelt is among the most common traffic violations in Wisconsin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<ul>
	<li>Bicycles, according to WI Statute, are considered vehicles. They have the same rights on the roadways as motor vehicles and they must obey the rules of the road like any other vehicle.</li>
	<li>Motorists should leave at least three feet when passing bicycles, more room at higher speeds.&nbsp; They should change lanes to pass any bicycle traveling, if possible.</li>
	<li>Motorists should look for bicycles in the opposing lane to them before they turn left. &nbsp;The most common cause of bicycle crashes is a motorist making a left turn across the path of an oncoming bicycle.</li>
	<li>Motorists should scan sidewalks and crosswalks for pedestrians and bicyclists.&nbsp; They must yield to pedestrians who have started crossing at an intersection or crosswalk.&nbsp; Motorists must also yield to pedestrians who have started crossing a roadway, within a marked or an unmarked crosswalk, at an intersection not controlled by traffic signals.</li>
	<li>Motorists should always look for bicyclists and pedestrians to their right side before they leave a stop light or stop sign. They should also look to the left and right side sidewalks when they are on a one-way street.</li>
	<li>Pedestrians should not suddenly move into the path of a closely approaching vehicle that does not have sufficient time to yield for them.</li>

<br />
Bicycles, according to WI Statute, are considered vehicles. They have the same rights on the roadways as motor vehicles and they must obey the rules of the road like any other vehicle.<br />
<br />
Motorists should leave at least three feet when passing bicycles, more room at higher speeds.&nbsp; They should change lanes to pass any bicycle traveling, if possible.<br />
<br />
Motorists should look for bicycles in the opposing lane to them before they turn left. &nbsp;The most common cause of bicycle crashes is a motorist making a left turn across the path of an oncoming bicycle.<br />
<br />
Motorists should scan sidewalks and crosswalks for pedestrians and bicyclists.&nbsp; They must yield to pedestrians who have started crossing at an intersection or crosswalk.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Motorists must also yield to pedestrians who have started crossing a roadway, within a marked or an unmarked crosswalk, at an intersection not controlled by traffic signals.<br />
<br />
Motorists should always look for bicyclists and pedestrians to their right side before they leave a stop light or stop sign. They should also look to the left and right side sidewalks when they are on a one-way street.<br />
<br />
Pedestrians should not suddenly move into the path of a closely approaching vehicle that does not have sufficient time to yield for them.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
This summer, the Madison Police Department will be conducting extra patrols that will focus on enforcing Wisconsin’s bicycle and pedestrian laws.&nbsp; These additional enforcement efforts are made possible through traffic overtime grants provided by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.<br />
<br />
The goal of these extra patrols is not only to enhance public safety, but to also educate citizens and to prevent needless tragedies. Throughout the past five years in Wisconsin, there have been 10,737 pedestrians and bicyclists crashes, resulting in 9799 injuries and 336 deaths.&nbsp; In 2022 alone, 1,378 pedestrians and 679 bicyclists in Wisconsin were involved in motor vehicle crashes, resulting in 74 and 14 deaths, respectively.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bicycles, according to WI Statute, are considered vehicles. They have the same rights on the roadways as motor vehicles and they must obey the rules of the road like any other vehicle.
<ul>
	<li>Motorists should leave at least three feet when passing bicycles, more room at higher speeds.&nbsp; They should change lanes to pass any bicycle traveling, if possible.</li>
	<li>Motorists should look for bicycles in the opposing lane to them before they turn left. &nbsp;The most common cause of bicycle crashes is a motorist making a left turn across the path of an oncoming bicycle.</li>
	<li>Motorists should scan sidewalks and crosswalks for pedestrians and bicyclists.&nbsp; They must yield to pedestrians who have started crossing at an intersection or crosswalk.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Motorists must also yield to pedestrians who have started crossing a roadway, within a marked or an unmarked crosswalk, at an intersection not controlled by traffic signals.</li>
	<li>Motorists should always look for bicyclists and pedestrians to their right side before they leave a stop light or stop sign. They should also look to the left and right side sidewalks when they are on a one-way street.</li>
	<li>Pedestrians should not suddenly move into the path of a closely approaching vehicle that does not have sufficient time to yield for them.</li>

<br />
Every 39 minutes in the United States, one person is killed in a drunk driving crash. More than 13,000 lives are lost each year.&nbsp; December is a particularly deadly month, especially during the holidays.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This year, from December 13, 2023 through January 1, 2024, the Madison Police Department and the Dane County Sheriff’s Department are taking part in the Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over campaign.&nbsp; The goals of this campaign are to educate people about the dangers and consequences of driving drunk, decrease impaired driving, prevent needless tragedies and save lives.<br />
<br />
But, we cannot do it alone.&nbsp; We need your help to make our roads safer.&nbsp; If you are celebrating and drinking this holiday season, always remember to have a plan to get home safely.&nbsp; Just one drink before driving can put you and others in danger, because alcohol impairs thinking, reasoning and muscle coordination.
<ul>
	<li>Always drive 100% sober. Even one alcoholic beverage could be one too many. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Plan ahead: Before you have even one drink, designate a sober driver to get you home safely.</li>
	<li>You have options to get home safely: designate a sober driver or call a taxi or rideshare. Getting home safely is always worth it.</li>
	<li>If it’s your turn to be the designated driver, take your job seriously and don’t drink.</li>
	<li>If you have a friend who is about to drink and drive, take the keys away and let a sober driver get your friend home safely.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
	<li>On average, every day, twenty pedestrians are killed by a moving vehicle in the United States.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pedestrian deaths have been climbing since 2010 - primarily due to motorists who drive recklessly and aggressively, speed and are distracted.</li>
	<li>Pedestrian and bicyclist deaths make up approximately 20% of all traffic-related fatalities in the United States.</li>
	<li>Approximately 76,000 pedestrians and 47,000 bicyclists are injured in roadway crashes annually in the United States.</li>
	<li>Speeding is a contributing factor in approximately 30% of all traffic fatalities in the United States.</li>
	<li>Someone is injured or killed in an impaired driving crash every two hours in Wisconsin.</li>
	<li>Thousands of unbuckled passenger vehicle occupants are killed every year in crashes throughout the United States.</li>

?The Madison Police Department will be joining law enforcement agencies across Wisconsin and the United States in stepping up the enforcement of seatbelt laws.&nbsp;The high-visibility&nbsp;Click It or Ticket&nbsp;seatbelt campaign, which coincides with the beginning of the busy summer travel season, runs from May 20 through June 2, 2024.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The purpose of the campaign is to remind motorists about the importance of seatbelt use, enforce the life-saving habit of wearing a seatbelt, and reduce the number of fatalities that occur when drivers and passengers fail to buckle up.&nbsp; Wisconsin’s primary seatbelt law allows law enforcement to stop and cite motorists for failing to wear a seatbelt. Drivers can also be cited for every unbuckled passenger in their vehicle.<br />
<br />
Wearing your seatbelt is one of the easiest and most effective steps you can take to survive a crash.&nbsp; If you know a friend or a family member who does not buckle up when they drive, please ask them to consider changing their habits. Help us spread this lifesaving message before one more friend or family member is killed as a result of this senseless inaction. Seat belts save lives, and everyone — front seat and back, child and adult — needs to remember to buckle up.<br />

30984,Fraud,2024-000000,2024/06/18 14:48:00+00,,,211 S Carroll St,,"The Madison Police Department is experiencing an increase in fraudulent cases where scammers are targeting retirement accounts. In reviewing reports on this incident, it sounds like victims are being greeted with a popup in their banking software telling them that a transfer of funds has been validated to a possible illicit activity, accusing the victim of engaging in illegal activity. The pop-up also has a phone number to call.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Once the number has been called, victims report being transferred to other phone lines or being asked to wait on calls. After being on the phone, they are asked to drain money from their accounts in order to transfer it to another individual so that the initial fraud could be investigated. Once all the money from their account is drained out, victims are being encouraged to purchase gold and to transfer that money.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Madison Police Department is aware of these cases and is actively investigating them. To keep your accounts safe, the Madison Police Department recommends:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Be cautious of any entity asking you to quickly transfer funds over the phone.<br />
If you see suspicious activity on your accounts, report it to your banking entity.<br />
Remember that law enforcement will not ask for funds in exchange for us to investigate a crime or alleged fraud.<br />
Take time to conduct internet searches of numbers given by these pop ups to see if they are legitimate.<br />
If someone is claiming you transferred funds from your account, take the time to independently verify if this occurred (logging onto your bank account or contacting your local branch).<br />
